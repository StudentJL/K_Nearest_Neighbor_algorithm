# K_Nearest_Neighbor_algorithm

Implementing K Nearest Neighbor classification algorithm using mainly Numpy

This code is written in Python programming language

Packages used in code: 
Numpy is used to calculate distances between data points when running the algorithm.
Pandas is used to display training data, but is not involved in the classification process. 
Statistics is used to find the mode of the predictions.
